# What is it?

It's a real time visualization of the commit count of all github repositories.
It uses [Satori's github events channel](https://www.satori.com/channels/github-events) for the data.

# Credits

I used @mbostock's d3 [Bubble Chart template](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269)
for the visualization.

# How is this useful?
It's not. It will suck up all your computer's memory in about 10 minutes.

# What did you find out?
Some people do terrible things to GitHub's servers...

# Conclusion

Finding any relevant data through this method is completely useless.
Make's me wonder how github finds trending repositories...
They must have a way to exclude such repos with high frequency automated commits..
